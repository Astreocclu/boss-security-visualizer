Step: windows

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Focusing on Security**

I'm currently identifying all the black-framed windows in the house. The goal is to install security mesh that appears flush within the frames. I plan to add realistic textures to the mesh and ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new additions.




[Part 2]
**Verifying the Execution**

I'm checking that the model has successfully implemented all aspects of the user's detailed instructions. The addition of the security screens, including the mesh and flush mounting, seems accurate. The lighting and textures are convincing. I'll confirm that the overall result aligns perfectly with the prompt.
