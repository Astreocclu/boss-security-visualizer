Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Analyzing Patio Security**

I am now focusing on the patio enclosure, specifically its dimensions and configuration. I need to determine the precise placement of the security screen and vertical aluminum mullions. The plan is to seamlessly integrate these elements while preserving the original aesthetics of the house and pool area.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Implementation Accuracy**

I'm focusing on the precise implementation of the user's requirements. I'm checking the accurate installation of the security screens, including the type of mesh, mounting, and mullion placement, and assessing how the lighting and other elements contribute to the overall realism. I have also verified that the result aligns closely with the user's initial specifications.
