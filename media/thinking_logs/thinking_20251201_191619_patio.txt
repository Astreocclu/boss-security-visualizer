Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Implementing Security Measures**

I am now focusing on the physical modifications required. I've pinpointed the two patio sections that need security screens. I'm currently working on placing heavy-duty black mesh within the existing frames, aiming for a semi-transparent effect. I am also adding vertical aluminum supports at regular intervals for added realism, ensuring they cast appropriate shadows. The rest of the scene remains untouched.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Instructions' Adherence**

I've been meticulously comparing the generated result against the initial user instructions. It seems every specified detail was accurately incorporated into the final image. I am focusing on the patio enclosure, specifically its material, mounting, and spacing, as well as the overall lighting. It appears to match the request.
