Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Enclosing the Space**

I'm now zeroing in on installing the security screen. I've pinpointed the open patio area and will add a black mesh enclosure across it. Next, I'll integrate vertical aluminum mullions at 5-foot intervals. The screen will be a heavy-duty, semi-transparent black mesh. I'm focusing on ensuring natural light and shadows are accurately rendered on the new mesh and mullions. Now, I will calculate and list the specs.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Component Integration**

I've just confirmed the accurate application of the security screen details. It's particularly satisfying to note the correct implementation of the vertical mullions according to the user's explicit instructions. This level of precision is exactly what I was aiming for. I'm proceeding to the next steps.




[Part 3]
OPENING WIDTH: 35 feet
MULLION COUNT: 7
POSITIONS: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 feet.
