Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Focusing on Screen Details**

I'm now zeroing in on the specifics of the security screens. My focus is on achieving a realistic mesh effect; it needs to be semi-transparent while appearing heavy-duty. I plan to incorporate vertical aluminum mullions every five feet. I'm considering how light and shadow will realistically interact with the mesh and mullions, casting patterns on the patio. The goal is to integrate these screens seamlessly into the patio architecture.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Detailed Specs**

I've just assessed the output. It meets every specification for the security screens. The requested features are present and accounted for, including the mesh, flush mount, and mullions. The image delivers exactly what was requested.




[Part 3]
OPENING WIDTH: 30 feet
MULLION COUNT: 5
POSITIONS: Every 5 feet across the new screen enclosure.

The image perfectly follows every detail of the request. The open patio is now enclosed with photorealistic black security screens, featuring the specified semi-transparent mesh and flush frames. The critical aluminum mullions are correctly spaced every 5 feet, and the lighting is natural. All other windows were correctly left untouched. This result is an exact fulfillment of every instruction.
