[Part 1]
**Focusing Backyard Renovation**

I'm now zeroing in on the backyard image cleanup. I've pinpointed all the temporary elements, from furniture to construction debris. My next steps involve systematically erasing these items and cleaning up the pool and patio. The goal is to produce a pristine backyard scene under a sunny sky. Finally, I will adjust the weather conditions by changing the cloudy sky to clear and sunny with white clouds. I'm focusing on the brick house, stone patio, and landscaping with proper illumination.




[Part 2]
**Verifying image accuracy**

I'm now cross-referencing the image with the user's prompt to ensure everything aligns perfectly. The model completed the requested object removals and adjusted the weather successfully. All key structural elements are as requested. I'm focusing on validating a precise match.
