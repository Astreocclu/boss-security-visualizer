Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Designing Security Screens**

I am now focusing on designing the black security screen system for the open patio. I am planning the placement of vertical mullions at five-foot intervals. The mesh will be semi-transparent and heavy-duty. I am working on the lighting to create realistic shadows on the patio floor. I must remember to leave the existing windows, doors, and plants untouched.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Image Accuracy**

I'm checking that the black security screen enclosure aligns precisely with the user's detailed description. The mesh, structural elements, and semi-transparent aspects seem accurate. I'm focusing on the correct placement of structural mullions and the realistic lighting effects. The result is a perfect match for all specifications, so I can advance.
