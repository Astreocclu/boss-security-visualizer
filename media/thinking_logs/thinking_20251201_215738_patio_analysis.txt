Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, note:
1. OPENING ANALYSIS: Estimate the width of each patio opening in feet
2. MULLION CALCULATION: How many mullions would be needed (1 per 5 feet)
3. POSITIONING: Where they should be placed IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Designing Security Measures**

I am currently working on the precise placement of security screens. I've broken down the patio openings, calculating the necessary mullions for each span. The focus is now on integrating these screens seamlessly, considering the material texture and how light interacts with it. Ensuring all surrounding elements stay untouched is crucial during this stage.




[Part 2]
**Approving Image Generation**

I've carefully assessed the image against the user's instructions. The execution of the specific elements, such as the patio enclosure and mullion spacing, is precisely as requested. Based on this thorough review, I've confirmed that the generated result aligns perfectly with the detailed guidelines provided.
