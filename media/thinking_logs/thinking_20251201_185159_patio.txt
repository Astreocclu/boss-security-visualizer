Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. Install vertical aluminum structural mullions every 5 feet to support the screen span. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Revising Security Measures**

I'm now zeroing in on the patio areas, both upper and lower levels, preparing them for the new security mesh. I have it in mind to use heavy-duty, semi-transparent black material for the mesh, and I plan to install black aluminum mullions every five feet to help keep the screens in place. I will also incorporate realistic lighting and shadow effects to make sure the mesh and frame blend in properly with the scene.




[Part 2]
**Refining Image Specifications**

I'm currently reviewing the details of the patio enclosure to ensure every element aligns with the initial request. I've focused particularly on the security screen and its integration, as well as the placement of vertical mullions and the overall lighting. The goal is to verify absolute precision in meeting all specified conditions.
