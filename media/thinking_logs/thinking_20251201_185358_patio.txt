Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. Install vertical aluminum structural mullions every 5 feet to support the screen span. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Adding Security Screens**

I am now focusing on the open second-floor patio. My priority is to install robust, see-through black security screens across the entire opening. Vertical black aluminum supports will be integrated every five feet for structural integrity. The system will be flush-mounted. Finally, I will adjust lighting and shadows realistically to show sunlight coming through the mesh. The rest of the scene remains untouched.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I've carefully compared the new visual output to the initial set of instructions. The rendering of the enclosures, including the black security screens, flush mounts, and vertical supports, appears accurate. Lighting and shadow effects on the semi-transparent mesh are now quite realistic. I can say that all the specified constraints have been addressed.
