Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Constructing Security Elements**

I'm now integrating heavy-duty security screens into the scene.  The plan involves flush-mounting the mesh to maintain lighting and shadow realism. My current focus is accurately mapping the window placements for precise screen integration. I'll then move on to refining the material properties to simulate the semi-transparent mesh.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating The Execution**

I'm currently focused on assessing the implementation of the user's specifications. The most recent check involved verifying that all the security screen attributes were accurately rendered according to the given details. I've double-checked the natural lighting and the texture's realistic appearance. I'm satisfied that everything aligns with the user's initial instructions, but I need to make sure.
