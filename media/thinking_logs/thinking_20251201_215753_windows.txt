Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Designing Security Screens**

I am now focusing on implementing the security screens across all identified windows. The goal is to achieve a balance between security and natural light. I'm prioritizing a semi-transparent black mesh material with flush-mounted frames for a sleek look. The focus is on a fine texture that allows a glimpse of what's behind the screens while ensuring effective coverage. Realistic sunlight and shadow integration is crucial for visual appeal.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Image Accuracy**

I'm currently focused on evaluating the image against the user's detailed specifications. The model successfully incorporated the requested security screens, complete with the correct texture and lighting effects. I'm carefully assessing the correspondence between the generated visual elements and the initial prompt to ensure complete alignment.
