Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. Install vertical aluminum structural mullions every 5 feet to support the screen span. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Implementing Security Screens**

I am now focusing on the physical modification of the image. My current task is to implement the security screens. I'm placing black mesh in the designated porch areas, incorporating vertical aluminum mullions for support at regular intervals. The screens must be flush-mounted to ensure visual coherence. I am also working on integrating accurate lighting and shadow effects to make the new additions appear realistic within the scene. Other windows remain as they were in the original image.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Design Execution**

I've confirmed the model's precise adherence to the provided specifications. Black security screens now exclusively cover the porch areas, featuring semi-transparent mesh as instructed. Vertical structural mullions are correctly positioned, with appropriate lighting interaction. The remaining windows were, as intended, left unaltered. I'm satisfied that this fulfills all requirements.
