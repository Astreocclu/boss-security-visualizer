--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Transforming the Scene**

I'm focusing on the environmental cleanup. The immediate goal is to establish a pristine outdoor space. Currently, I'm working through the object removal list: furniture, construction debris, and unwanted plants are going first. After that, I will modify the lighting and weather conditions.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing the Output**

I've examined the image against the user's instructions. The temporary clutter is gone, replaced with a clear, sunny scene, matching the specifications perfectly. Structures are unaltered, aligning with the prompt's intent. The outcome fulfills the request.
