Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Framing a Secure Space**

I'm now zeroing in on the open patio, meticulously identifying the area that needs the screen enclosure. I'll be adding the heavy-duty black mesh, complete with the support mullions, ensuring natural light and shadows interact realistically with the structure. Next step is to integrate the support posts to the existing architecture.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Precision and Accuracy**

I'm now cross-referencing the image with the specific guidelines. This ensures the implementation of black security screens with a semi-transparent mesh, including the crucial vertical mullions at the right spacing. The preservation of all initial elements is a high priority. I am meticulously confirming the prompt's specifications have been met.
