Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Planning Security Enhancements**

I'm focusing on the practical application of security measures for an open patio. The design specifies black, heavy-duty mesh screens with vertical aluminum mullions, spaced at 5-foot intervals, across a 20-foot opening. I'm taking care to accurately reflect the materials and integration into the existing patio structure, ensuring a realistic visual representation. The current focus is on accurate measurements and component placement.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing User Requirements**

I've carefully assessed the generated image against the user's explicit directives. I can confirm the implementation of all specified structural elements, notably the security screens, mesh, and aluminum mullions. The preservation of the original windows is also verifiable. Based on my analysis, the result aligns with the provided criteria. I'm ready to proceed with the next step.
