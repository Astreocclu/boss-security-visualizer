Step: cleanup

Please clean this image of any debris, furniture, and temporary items.
Make the weather conditions ideal and sunny with clear blue sky.
Keep all permanent structures exactly as they are.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Modifying Scene Lighting**

I'm currently focused on removing all temporary items, like furniture and debris, from the porch and surrounding areas. Once that is done, the sky will be transformed from cloudy to a clear blue. Bright sunlight will then be added to the entire scene, creating sharp shadows and highlighting the materials of the porch, like the wood beams and brick. Finally, I will ensure the grass is clean and well-kept.




[Part 2]
**Confirming the Changes**

The generation successfully addressed the temporary elements and weather, while the core architectural elements and their placements remained unchanged as specified.  I can confirm the request was fully satisfied by this iteration, and I'm ready to proceed.
