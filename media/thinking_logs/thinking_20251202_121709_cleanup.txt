[Part 1]
**Clean & Transform the scene**

I've begun the process of cleaning up the scene. I started by removing all temporary items like furniture, construction materials, and debris from the patio and pool area. Next, I am working on clarifying the pool and spa water, making it a sparkling blue. I've also started adjusting the sky to be a bright, clear blue. I'm focusing now on enhancing the lighting to create a bright, sunny daylight effect. My next task is to ensure all permanent structures remain unchanged.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I'm checking the generated image against the user's instructions. I can see the model successfully followed all the instructions, cleaning the pool and altering the weather. Crucially, the permanent structures of the house remain unchanged, validating that the prompt was fulfilled. I can approve the image.
