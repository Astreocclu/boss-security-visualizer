--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Establishing a Base Scenario**

I'm focusing on establishing a clear, permanent base scene, starting with the house and pool. All temporary construction items, clutter, and irrelevant elements are being systematically removed. Simultaneously, I'm working to transform the cloudy sky into a bright blue one, while enhancing the lighting for a sunny day feel. The landscaping, especially the red-flowered bush and potted plant, are under consideration for their overall vibrance.




[Part 2]
**Validating Scene Accuracy**

I'm checking that the generated scene precisely reflects the user's input. The removal of unwanted elements like clutter, construction materials, and furniture appears complete. I'm confirming that the pool and sky are rendered appropriately and that permanent structures are intact, consistent with the brief.
