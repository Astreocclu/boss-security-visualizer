[Part 1]
**Creating the Transformation**

I'm currently focused on the transformation process. The goal is to shift from the construction site to the backyard scene. The house, patio, and pool are being preserved as the base. All temporary elements and debris, as planned, are being removed, with the pool cleaned and sky updated. Lighting is being considered for that warm sunlight and sharp shadows.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Image Compliance**

I've completed a thorough comparison of the image against the user's initial instructions. The objective was the removal of specific items and a weather adjustment, while preserving permanent structures. The analysis confirms all stated criteria were successfully met, and I'm ready to finalize the result.
