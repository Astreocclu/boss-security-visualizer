Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Installing Security Screens**

I am currently working on implementing security screens for all windows and doors in the scene. I've begun identifying all the relevant openings and will then focus on adding the mesh to the existing frames. The goal is to create a realistic, semi-transparent appearance so that the added screens look integrated and not out of place. This involves careful consideration of how the lighting and shadows interact with the mesh to create a believable texture.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Prompt Adherence**

I've been evaluating the model's output against the user's prompt. The model successfully incorporated the specified security screens onto the windows and patio. Photorealistic elements, including lighting and shadows, have been incorporated into the current results. The visual representation aligns with the described requirements.
