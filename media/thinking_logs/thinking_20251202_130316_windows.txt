Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Focusing on Windows**

I'm now zeroing in on the windows. My next step is to add the security screens. I'm prioritizing realistic integration. The material will be heavy-duty black mesh, allowing visibility through the glass. Frame details are crucial, ensuring flush mounting and a cohesive look. Lighting and shadow effects will add realism.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating The Alignment**

I'm now carefully examining the image against the user's initial specifications, focusing on aspects like the security screens' installation, mesh type, and overall realism. I have verified that all the requested components are present and correctly implemented, so I will approve this generation.
