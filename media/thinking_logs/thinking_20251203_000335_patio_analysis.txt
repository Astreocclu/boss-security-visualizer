Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Developing Enclosure Details**

I'm focusing now on adding the black security screens. I'm visualizing them as heavy-duty, semi-transparent mesh, flush-mounted within the existing structure. I'm paying close attention to the interplay of light and shadow on the mesh, ensuring a realistic visual effect. I'm also planning the placement of aluminum structural mullions every 5 feet to reinforce the screen wall.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating User Instructions**

I've carefully assessed the output against the original user guidelines. Every element requested in the prompt, from the black security screens to the spacing of structural mullions, has been satisfactorily addressed. The generated visuals align precisely with the requirements, indicating a successful response.
