Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Focusing Security Upgrades**

I'm now implementing the black security screen system on the patio. The screens are heavy-duty, semi-transparent mesh, and I'm spacing aluminum mullions every five feet. I'm taking care to ensure the new structures are flush-mounted to maintain the integrity of the original brick architecture. The lighting and shadows are being adjusted to reflect the new elements realistically. The plan is to complete this without altering any other aspect of the image.




[Part 2]
**Examining Image Compliance**

I'm checking that the created image fully meets the user's detailed requirements. The heavy-duty security screens and flush mounting are present. The image reflects natural lighting and correct structural mullion spacing, leaving the standard windows unaltered. The image is now ready for incorporating precise measurements.
