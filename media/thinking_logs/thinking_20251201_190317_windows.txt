Step: windows

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Implementing Security Measures**

I'm currently focused on incorporating security screens into the house image. I've identified the windows on both floors and am working on integrating the black, semi-transparent mesh. The goal is a realistic effect, with the screens appearing as though they are actually mounted in the existing frames. Lighting and shadow effects are key to achieving a metallic texture under the sunlight.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Accuracy Now**

I'm currently reviewing the image to ensure complete alignment with the user's detailed request. My focus is on the execution of specific instructions, particularly the realistic rendering of textures and the overall photorealism. I'm checking for accuracy in every detail and striving to meet all the criteria within the prompt.
