[Part 1]
**Modifying Existing Imagery**

I'm currently working on enhancing an existing image. The focus is on incorporating realistic security screens onto the windows of a brick facade. The goal is to make the screens appear flush-mounted and semi-transparent, complete with natural light and shadow effects.

**Analyzing Perfection**

I'm now focusing on a direct comparison between the user's detailed request and the generated output. The system has completed every instruction. Currently, I'm specifically evaluating the black security screens, ensuring the frames are flush and the mesh texture is accurate. My assessment is centered on how well the output aligns with the original specifications.
