Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Designing Security Screens**

I am currently working on integrating realistic black security screens into the existing architectural image. My primary focus right now is on the semi-transparent black mesh texture and how it interacts with the current sunlight and shadow conditions. I need to make sure the mesh integrates well with the current window trim.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Request Compliance**

I'm now thoroughly examining the image against the user's instructions. Every detail of the requested security screens, including the mesh and frames, has been rendered. The lighting appears realistic and integrated with the scene. The goal is to determine if the generated content fully adheres to the user's original specifications.
