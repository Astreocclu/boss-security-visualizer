Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Please clean this image of any debris, furniture, and temporary items.
Make the weather conditions ideal and sunny with clear blue sky.
Keep all permanent structures exactly as they are.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Defining Key Changes**

I am now focusing on the specific changes to make. First, I will analyze the original image to identify all removable objects: furniture, debris, and tools. Then, I plan to remove these items from the patio, pool, and construction area. Finally, I will clean the pool and change the weather to be sunny, and add sunlight and textures to enhance the scene.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Visual Compliance**

I've examined the generated image and am satisfied that all elements explicitly requested for removal are absent. The alteration to a sunny weather condition is also present, completing the requested visual transformation, based on my analysis of the input prompt.
