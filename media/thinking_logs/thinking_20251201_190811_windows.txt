Step: windows

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Developing the Security Screen Design**

I'm now focusing on the detailed implementation of the security screens. Identifying all the windows is complete. I'm prioritizing the material choice for the screens – a fine, heavy-duty black mesh that's semi-transparent, showing the grid pattern while allowing some visibility. Next, I'll work on the flush mounting of the frames and ensure the lighting interacts realistically with the mesh.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Visual Accuracy**

I'm checking the generated visual content against the initial user specifications. Currently, I'm focusing on ensuring accurate and complete replication of the requested elements. So far, the model has seemingly addressed all instructions successfully, including specific details like the type of material and installation. This iteration aims to rigorously confirm complete compliance.
