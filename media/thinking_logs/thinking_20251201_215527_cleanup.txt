Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Please clean this image of any debris, furniture, and temporary items.
Make the weather conditions ideal and sunny with clear blue sky.
Keep all permanent structures exactly as they are.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Removing All Distractions**

I'm focusing now on removing the temporary items. The objective is to have the pool, pool house, and landscaping stand alone. I'm ensuring everything is clean, and the temporary elements are gone, as described. My next step is to replace the sky and adjust the lighting.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Compliance**

I'm checking that the model has accurately followed all the instructions. The result is a sunny scene, devoid of people or temporary furniture, while preserving all permanent structures with precision. It seems to align precisely with the prompt's requirements.
