Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---

Make the weather conditions ideal and sunny with clear blue sky.
Keep all permanent structures exactly as they are.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Redefining the Scene**

I've begun by removing the extraneous elements from the original image, focusing on a pristine presentation. This includes eliminating all temporary items, people, and the overcast sky. The goal is a clean canvas. I'm now transitioning to the bright and sunny scene, with clear blue skies and sharp shadows for enhanced realism. The black wire mesh and concrete forms remain prominent features in the revised composition.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Scene Fidelity**

I'm currently checking the generated image against the initial user request. I've confirmed the absence of specific elements, ensuring alignment with the instructions. The weather conditions were successfully altered, maintaining the integrity of permanent structures. The output appears consistent with the user's defined parameters.
