[Part 1]
**Envisioning Security Screens**

I'm now focusing on adding black security screens to the windows. Specifically, I'm working on the arched windows on the right. These screens should be made of a heavy-duty, semi-transparent black mesh, and the frames will be black and flush with the window frames. The main focus is to ensure the screens realistically interact with the sunlight, casting natural shadows and highlighting the mesh's texture.

**Analyzing The Request**

I've carefully assessed the generated image in light of the user's detailed instructions. The implementation of the heavy-duty security screens appears to be accurate, with the specified mesh and mounting correctly applied. Lighting interaction with the new elements seems natural and believable, suggesting an effective rendering of the requested modifications. I am ready to present this result to the user.
