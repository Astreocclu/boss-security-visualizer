--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Crafting a Transformation**

I'm currently focused on removing all non-permanent elements, like furniture and debris, to achieve a pristine pool area. Subsequently, I plan to work on surface cleaning to ensure the pool and surrounding areas are spotless. The final touches will involve replacing the overcast sky with a clear, sunny one and incorporating warm sunlight for realistic shadows and reflections.




[Part 2]
**Confirming Scene Integrity**

I'm verifying that the image adheres to the specified scene. The model has successfully removed all unwanted elements. The change to sunny weather is accurate, and the permanent structures are well-maintained, meeting all requirements.
