Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Envisioning Security Screens**

I'm now fully immersed in the goal of adding realistic security screens to the building. Currently, I'm at the stage of envisioning how the black mesh would interact with the sunlight, focusing on the shadows and highlights. I'm taking the sun's position and the material's opacity into consideration to achieve a natural look.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing prompt fulfillment**

I'm now cross-referencing the image against the original, detailed request. I've noted the presence of black security screens on all openings, complete with mesh and flush frames, which seems to fulfill the user's specification. I am focusing on the realism of the lighting and shadows, and comparing the current output to the original prompt's requirements.
