Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Developing Security Measures**

I am currently working on implementing security screens onto the existing architectural image. The goal is to accurately depict heavy-duty, semi-transparent black mesh securely attached to the windows. I've begun by identifying all the windows on the house, from the bay window to the smaller ones. I plan to focus on realistic lighting effects that interact with the mesh, creating a natural appearance.




[Part 2]
**Confirming Complete Accuracy**

I have carefully reviewed the generated image against the user's detailed specifications. The execution of each instruction is accurate. The new components, including the security screens, are implemented according to the parameters described. I have verified that lighting and shadows appear realistic on the surfaces and elements. The image is now aligned with the initial user prompt.
