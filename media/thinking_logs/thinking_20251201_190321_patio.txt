Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Developing the Enclosure**

I'm currently working on incorporating the security screen system. My approach focuses on integrating it realistically with the existing patio area. I'm prioritizing the visual impact of the black mesh and aluminum supports, aiming for a flush, natural appearance. Light and shadow interplay are key to achieve a believable integration of the added elements.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I have carefully assessed the details. The black security screens, with their semi-transparent mesh and vertical mullions, were added to the patio as instructed. The implementation appeared flush, and the lighting and shadows were realistic. It seems that the criteria have been fulfilled, and the project is ready for the next stage.
