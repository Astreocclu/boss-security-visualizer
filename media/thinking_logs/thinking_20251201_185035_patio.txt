Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. Install vertical aluminum structural mullions every 5 feet to support the screen span. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Revising Security Measures**

I'm now focusing on integrating the security screens. Identifying the existing open areas is complete. The plan is to install black screens and supporting mullions. Ensuring the lighting and shadows are realistic to the screens is a high priority. I'm taking care to preserve the original elements without alteration.




[Part 2]
**Examining Image Compliance**

I'm currently reviewing the final image against the initial detailed requirements. The enclosed patio areas with black security screens, flush mounting, and correct mullion spacing all seem to be present, and it is a match for the prompt.
