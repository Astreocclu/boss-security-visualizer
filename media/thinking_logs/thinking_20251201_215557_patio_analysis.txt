Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, note:
1. OPENING ANALYSIS: Estimate the width of each patio opening in feet
2. MULLION CALCULATION: How many mullions would be needed (1 per 5 feet)
3. POSITIONING: Where they should be placed IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Determining Mullion Placement**

I've been calculating the precise placement of aluminum mullions for the security screens. Specifically, the main patio opening requires four mullions and the side opening needs two. I'm focusing on ensuring these are evenly spaced to maintain structural integrity and a uniform aesthetic. Next, I plan to refine the material rendering to be heavy-duty black mesh within flush frames, incorporating realistic lighting and shadows.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Image Alignment**

I'm currently focused on evaluating the image against the user's explicit directives. I've noted the successful rendering of the security screen, mesh, and flush frames. A key aspect I am assessing is the precise calculation and placement of the aluminum mullions every five feet. I am also carefully observing the lighting and shadows to ensure they meet the criteria.
