Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Please clean this image of any debris, furniture, and temporary items.
Make the weather conditions ideal and sunny with clear blue sky.
Keep all permanent structures exactly as they are.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Removing unwanted items**

I'm working on removing all non-permanent items from the image. This involves removing the umbrella, chairs, table, grill, and cover. I will also be transforming the dreary sky into a sunny day. The house, pool, and surrounding landscape will remain unchanged. Then, I will adjust the lighting to reflect a warm, sunny day.




[Part 2]
**Validating Image Accuracy**

I have finished cross-checking the result. I confirmed the removal of the requested items and accurate manipulation of the weather and preservation of the structures as requested. All elements are aligned with the user's explicit instructions.
