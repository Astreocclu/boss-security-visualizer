Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, note:
1. OPENING ANALYSIS: Estimate the width of each patio opening in feet
2. MULLION CALCULATION: How many mullions would be needed (1 per 5 feet)
3. POSITIONING: Where they should be placed IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Constructing Security Elements**

I've determined the optimal placement for the black security screens and structural mullions, considering the existing patio's architectural features. The left opening requires two mullions at 5ft and 10ft, and the center opening needs three at 5ft, 10ft, and 15ft. The screens will be flush with the existing structure. I'm focusing on ensuring realistic visual integration with lighting and details.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Complex Details**

I have carefully assessed the most recent iteration against the original, extensive instructions provided by the user. I confirmed the patio's enclosure with black security screens and structural mullions at the precise five-foot intervals. The flush mounting, natural lighting, and material rendering are also verified as meeting the photorealistic demands of the prompt.
