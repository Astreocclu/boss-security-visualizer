Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Visualizing the Security Mesh**

I'm now fully focused on the patio, specifically the implementation of the security mesh. The task is to create a realistic, semi-transparent black mesh across the opening. I'm prioritizing the visibility of the vertical aluminum mullions, spaced at five-foot intervals. The current emphasis is on achieving a convincing play of light and shadow on the newly added texture, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the existing scene.




[Part 2]
**Checking all details**

I've meticulously reviewed the output against all original instructions. The specifications for the black security screen, including its coverage, vertical supports, and semi-transparent nature, have been addressed. The model appears to have handled all the details.
