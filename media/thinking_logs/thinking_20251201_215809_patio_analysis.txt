Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, note:
1. OPENING ANALYSIS: Estimate the width of each patio opening in feet
2. MULLION CALCULATION: How many mullions would be needed (1 per 5 feet)
3. POSITIONING: Where they should be placed IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Constructing the Enclosure**

I've been calculating the necessary mullion placements for the security screen. I've determined I need three or four for the main patio opening and one for the side. My focus is on achieving an even, realistic distribution within the framework of the existing structure. I'm moving toward visualizing the placement now.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Detail Alignment**

I have carefully assessed the image, focusing on the critical elements. The security screens' placement and the spacing of the vertical mullions meet all the set parameters. The materials and lighting effects are acceptable. This confirms the image's adherence to the complete instructions provided.
