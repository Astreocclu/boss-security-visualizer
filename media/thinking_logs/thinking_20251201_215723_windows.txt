Step: windows

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Analyzing Window Security**

I am now focusing on integrating security screens into the initial scene. The process involves identifying windows, applying the mesh material, and adding mounting frames. Currently, I am prioritizing realistic lighting to accurately represent shadows and textures. The aim is to achieve a seamless integration that preserves the natural light while adding the security elements.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Fidelity**

I'm now carefully checking the generated image against the initial user request. All security screens are rendered accurately, including their materials and installation. The overall lighting and shadow integration aligns closely with the prompt's specifications. The output seems to fulfill all outlined requirements.
