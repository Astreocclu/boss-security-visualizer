Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Target the Open Space**

I'm focusing now on the open patio area and will add heavy-duty security screens within the large archway, as planned. I am considering the structure and its integration with the existing architecture. My plan is to include vertical black aluminum mullions to the screen for support, at regular intervals, while being mindful to preserve the scene. The mesh will be rendered as a semi-transparent, heavy-duty black material, and I'll pay attention to shadows and light filtering for a realistic look.




[Part 2]
**Checking Against Instructions**

I've carefully assessed the output against the specific requirements. I've ensured all details, from the security screen enclosure to the mullion spacing, are accurately represented. The semi-transparent texture and lighting effects are also under review for their accurate portrayal of the scene.
