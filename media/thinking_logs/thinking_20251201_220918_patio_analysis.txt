Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Adding Security Screens**

I am now focusing on the open patio area to integrate the heavy-duty black security screen enclosure. The emphasis is on realism, specifically the material properties and lighting. I'm working to position vertical aluminum mullions at regular intervals for structural support. My aim is to make the new elements appear integrated with the existing scene. The dimensions and the number of mullions will be determined as requested.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Visual Accuracy**

I'm currently checking this image against the user's explicit structural requirements. The presence and precise placement of the mullions are paramount. It seems the visual interpretation aligns with the desired features. I'm focusing on confirming the meticulous adherence to all provided specifications. I will approve if there are no deviations from the user's intent.




[Part 3]
OPENING WIDTH: 20 feet
MULLION COUNT: 3
POSITIONS: 5 ft, 10 ft, 15 ft
