Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Developing Security Features**

I'm currently working on enhancing the security features of the scene. My focus is on integrating heavy-duty security screens into the existing architecture. The process involves identifying all glass surfaces and then applying the screens, complete with thin metal frames. I'm prioritizing realistic shadows and ensuring the mesh is semi-transparent.




[Part 2]
**Approving The Result**

I've carefully assessed the image against the user's initial request. I can confirm that the security screens have been rendered to meet the provided specifications exactly. The semi-transparent mesh and flush mounting are accurate, and the lighting is realistic. The overall result aligns perfectly with the initial user prompt, so I will proceed with the next step.
