Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Developing the Scene**

I am now focusing on the insertion of security screens into the initial scene. I have identified the glazed areas needing modification. I am proceeding to integrate robust, dark, translucent mesh coverings, ensuring their frames seamlessly connect with the existing structures. The current work is centered on achieving realistic lighting effects and shadows cast by the new mesh.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Prompt Compliance**

I'm now cross-referencing the image with the initial user instructions.  The rendering included security screens and flush mounting as requested. Lighting and shadow effects appear realistic as well, which makes the generated image align with the prompt.
