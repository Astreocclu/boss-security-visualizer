Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the entry doors. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Constructing Security Screens**

I'm currently working on adding heavy-duty security screens to the existing sliding glass doors. The goal is a semi-transparent black mesh that integrates seamlessly with the original frames. I'm focusing on rendering the material realistically, paying close attention to light and shadow interactions to create a natural appearance of depth and detail within the scene.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Accuracy & Details**

I'm now comparing the generated image to the user's instructions. The image appears to match all of the detailed requirements provided. The security screen installation and material textures seem accurate, and lighting is natural. I'm focusing on the flush mounting and other fine details of the request.
