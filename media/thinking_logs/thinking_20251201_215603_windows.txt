Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Revising Security Measures**

I'm now integrating the black security screens onto the house facade. I've pinpointed the window panels and am working on ensuring the mesh texture and light interaction appear authentic. The goal is a heavy-duty, yet partially transparent, rendering.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Compliance**

I'm checking that the generated image satisfies the user's detailed request for large security screens, not just windows, based on the patio design. The result includes the correct features, heavy-duty black mesh, flush mounting, and realistic lighting, which meet the criteria. I'm preparing the presentation of this output.
