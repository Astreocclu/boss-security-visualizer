[Part 1]
**Isolating Core Elements**

I'm now focusing on isolating the house and oak trees, which are the essential elements. Removing all the furniture and clutter from the patio and yard is the next priority. I need to make sure the weather is perfect, with bright sun and clear blue skies, so I am removing the black tarp and all the pots, to make way for a good sky. Then I want to enhance the grass and clean mulched areas.




[Part 2]
**Validating Image Accuracy**

I've confirmed the image's accuracy against the user's prompt. It successfully eliminated temporary elements and adjusted the weather to a sunny day, leaving permanent features unchanged. I am now proceeding with next steps.
