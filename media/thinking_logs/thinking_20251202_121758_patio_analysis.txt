Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Enclosing the Patio**

I'm now focused on the patio enclosure, specifically its material and structural components. I've decided on heavy-duty, semi-transparent black security mesh and black aluminum mullions spaced five feet apart. The mounting will need to be flush with the brick and eaves to look realistic. I'm working to get the lighting and shadows right to make this look seamless with the original image.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Prompt Compliance**

I'm now cross-referencing the image with the initial user instructions. The model adhered precisely to the technical requirements, including the correct security screen specifications and mullion placement. The result meets the criteria.
