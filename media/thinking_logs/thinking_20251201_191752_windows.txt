Step: windows

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Modifying the Scene**

I'm currently focused on the practical aspects of adding security screens to the existing image. My primary concern is the integration of these screens: I must ensure the black mesh panels appear seamlessly integrated and match the existing frames and openings.  I'm also considering the appropriate lighting and shadows to enhance realism.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing alignment completion**

I've examined the image against the user's instructions. The security screens on the windows and balcony opening seem to be present and meet the described specifications. The mounting and lighting also appear consistent with the prompt. I think this result aligns with the request.
