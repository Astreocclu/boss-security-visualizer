Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Beginning the Design Process**

I'm starting by analyzing the original patio structure to understand the layout. I've begun designing a black mesh screen system with vertical aluminum mullions spaced every five feet. Currently, I am focused on ensuring the new screens will be flush with the brick columns and wall, aiming for a seamless integration. I'll need to incorporate natural lighting and shadows to realistically show the mesh's texture.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Specifications Closely**

I am now thoroughly checking the image against every detail of the user's requirements. The presence and spacing of the aluminum mullions is a key point, and I have confirmed their placement. The lighting feels realistic, and the original elements seem undisturbed. I'm ready to present the validated result.




[Part 3]
Based on your request, the black security screens have been installed on the patio enclosure.

OPENING WIDTH: 35 feet
MULLION COUNT: 6
POSITIONS: 5 ft, 10 ft, 15 ft, 20 ft, 25 ft, 30 ft
