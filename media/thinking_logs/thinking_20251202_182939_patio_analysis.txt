Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Implementing Security Measures**

I am now focusing on implementing the security screens across the open patio area. I'm carefully considering how the semi-transparent mesh will interact with sunlight and cast realistic shadows. The integration of vertical aluminum mullions at regular intervals is a critical aspect, and I'm ensuring these will be prominent. The goal is to install the screens and frames without altering the original architecture, which will include flush-mounted black frames.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Exact Match**

I am now thoroughly analyzing the generated image's fidelity to the user's instructions. Every element seems accounted for, from the black screens to the mullions. It accurately represents the prompt. I will proceed with assessing whether it fulfills the user's needs.
