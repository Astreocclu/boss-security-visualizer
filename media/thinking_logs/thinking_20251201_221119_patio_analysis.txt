Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Implementing Security Measures**

I am currently working on implementing security screens in the image. I started with the original patio scene and am now adding a black, semi-transparent mesh screen beneath the dark wood beam. Flush-mounted frames will be installed. I'm also adding four equally spaced black aluminum support posts. Lighting and shadow realism are my next considerations. Everything else will remain untouched.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating Image Fidelity**

I'm currently assessing the generated image's fidelity to the provided user instructions. I've focused on comparing the image details with the user's specific requirements. The primary focus is on how accurately the described elements are rendered.
