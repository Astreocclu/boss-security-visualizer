Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Refining Patio Security**

I'm now zeroing in on the patio enclosure, specifically the screens. I have a clearer direction now - the existing screens need to go, replaced with the new black security mesh. The addition of the vertical aluminum mullions is also a core focus now. Making sure the black frames meet up nicely with the brick pillars is key to making this work. Finally, realistic lighting and shadows are still being considered.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Compliance**

I'm checking that the model has successfully implemented all the requested patio enclosure features. The image now has the crucial mullions spaced correctly, and the heavy-duty mesh appears as instructed. Lighting and shadowing appear acceptable, and I'm verifying the rest of the details. I'm moving on to review any areas still outstanding, to make sure the original request has been fully met.
