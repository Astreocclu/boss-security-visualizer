Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Constructing Security Overlays**

I am now focusing on the window security screens. I've pinpointed all the windows and am installing black, heavy-duty mesh. I'm prioritizing flush mounting and realistic woven textures. Sunlight and shadows are being incorporated for a more integrated and dynamic effect. The goal is to make the screens look like they are a natural part of the house and not just an add-on.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Fidelity**

I'm currently reviewing the final image against the initial user specifications. My current focus is ensuring the details align perfectly with the original request. The security features appear to be in the correct positions with the requested specifications. The mounting and material textures also appear to be consistent. I am now proceeding with a final check to confirm overall coherence with the original instructions.
