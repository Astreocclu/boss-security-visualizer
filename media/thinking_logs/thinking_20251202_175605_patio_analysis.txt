Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Calculating Security Needs**

I've scoped out the patio enclosure and am determining the dimensions to calculate the number of mullions required. The next step is placing the security screens and aluminum mullions, taking care to make sure they look like they're actually a part of the scene. After that, I will work on realistic lighting to finalize.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing the Match**

I'm comparing the result to the user's input, specifically focusing on the patio enclosure details. The image has the requested features, including the mesh and mullions. The lighting appears satisfactory for the specified scene. It seems to align with the prompt.
