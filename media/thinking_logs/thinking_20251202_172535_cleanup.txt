[Part 1]
**Working on Scene Refinement**

I'm now focusing on cleaning up the scene. My current task is to remove all temporary elements like furniture, tools, and the scaffolding. Next, I'll address surface cleanup, eliminating debris and leaves from the patio and pool area. Finally, I'm working on replacing the overcast sky with a clear blue one and applying appropriate sunlight to the scene. I am ensuring that the brick and stone structures remain unchanged throughout this process.




[Part 2]
**Confirming Complete Fulfillment**

I've carefully compared the output with the user's initial request. I've confirmed that the specified elements were successfully addressed and the image accurately reflects the desired changes. All essential aspects appear to be correctly preserved and enhanced as instructed. This output aligns with the user's precise specifications and I will deliver it.
