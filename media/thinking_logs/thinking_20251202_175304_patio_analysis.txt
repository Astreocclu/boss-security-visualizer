Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Implementing Security Measures**

I am now focusing on implementing the security screens for the patio. The plan is to add black security screens with heavy-duty, semi-transparent mesh and prominent structural mullions. Specifically, I'm working on the design with flush-mounted black aluminum frames and vertical mullions spaced every 5 feet. I am also planning the lighting and shadows to ensure realistic rendering of the new mesh and mullions, while leaving the existing scene elements untouched.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Structural Integrity**

The image adheres precisely to the user's explicit structural requirements. The semi-transparent mesh and flush frames, especially the key detail of the mullions at 5-foot intervals, are exactly as specified. I'm now certain this image aligns with the requested design and structural demands.
