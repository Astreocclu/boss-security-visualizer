Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Developing the Scene's Details**

I'm currently working on incorporating the security screens. My focus is on realistically integrating them into the scene. I have identified the windows and am designing the screens to be flush-mounted with appropriate frames, ensuring accurate texturing and realistic lighting effects.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing the Results**

I've carefully assessed the output against the original request. The implementation of all the specifications has been completed. The focus is now on confirming the precise execution of each element, particularly the security mesh and framing, to ensure a complete correspondence with the user's requirements. The next step is to prepare this work.
