[Part 1]
**Modifying Security Features**

I'm currently working on incorporating the security screens. My focus is on the right side windows. I'm ensuring the mesh texture is heavy-duty and the screens are precisely flush with the frames, and I'm adding realistic lighting interactions to create the correct ambiance.
