Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Developing Security Measures**

I am currently working on implementing security screens onto the house image. My focus is on the correct placement and appearance of the new mesh. The screens are being rendered as heavy-duty, black, semi-transparent mesh with flush-mounted frames. I am considering realistic lighting and shadows to improve the mesh texture and integration. The aim is to darken the window areas slightly, while showing a view into the interior.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Fidelity**

I'm checking that the generated image aligns with the user's initial instructions, focusing on the security screen details. The prompt called for black screens with heavy-duty mesh and flush mounting on all windows. I am evaluating whether the image accurately represents this. I am now looking to see if the lighting and shadows play well with this new mesh.
