Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Enhancing Security Measures**

I'm currently working on enhancing the security features of the image. The plan is to seamlessly integrate photorealistic black security screens onto all the windows. I am ensuring that the mesh is semi-transparent so one can still see inside, and that the frames are flush with the existing window trim. The goal is to make the additions look completely natural with appropriate lighting and shadows. The aim is to create a sense of added security without detracting from the overall aesthetic.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing the Request**

I'm comparing the output to the user's detailed specifications. The execution of each instruction is being assessed. Currently, I'm focusing on the rendering of the security screens and the lighting interactions with them. I'm checking for accuracy in the mounting and the creation of textures and shadows.
