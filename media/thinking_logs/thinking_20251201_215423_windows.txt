Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Installing Security Screens**

I am currently working on the security screens for the house image. My focus is on the correct placement and appearance. I will ensure the new black frames are flush with the brick, and I am paying close attention to the mesh texture and how it interacts with the light. The original scene remains unchanged.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Precise Execution**

I've completed a thorough comparison of the output to the initial user request. I've confirmed that all aspects of the user's instructions regarding the security screens, including the mesh and mounting details, are present in the rendering. I'm focusing on the interaction of light and shadow with the added textures to finalize my analysis.
