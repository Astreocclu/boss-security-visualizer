Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Installing Security Screens**

I am currently working on adding realistic black security screens to all the windows of the house in the image. I have identified all the windows, including the arched ones. Next, I will install the heavy-duty black security screens with a semi-transparent mesh onto every window pane. The frames will be flush and match the black mesh. I will then add realistic lighting and shadows to the new mesh, showing texture and the dark, semi-transparent view of the interior behind it. The other elements remain unchanged.




[Part 2]
**Confirming Precise Execution**

I've meticulously compared the generated image against the user's comprehensive instructions. The model nailed the heavy-duty black security screens on all windows, including the patio enclosure, with semi-transparent mesh and flush mounting. Furthermore, the natural lighting and shadows on the new texture seem remarkably realistic. The end result aligns precisely with all specified criteria.
