Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Refining the Enclosure**

I'm now focusing on the structural details. My thought process is to integrate heavy-duty security screens into the patio image. I'm carefully calculating the positions of vertical aluminum mullions, spacing them consistently every five feet. I'm prioritizing a flush-mounted appearance for the new screens and mullions, and I'll ensure realistic lighting and shadows. The original image will stay intact, except for the modifications to the patio.




[Part 2]
**Verifying image accuracy**

I'm currently checking the image against the user's instructions. The enclosure design, including the security mesh and mullions at the required intervals, appears accurate. The modifications seem to be limited to the target area as requested. I'm focusing on the technical aspects and alignment with the prompt's details.
