Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, note:
1. OPENING ANALYSIS: Estimate the width of each patio opening in feet
2. MULLION CALCULATION: How many mullions would be needed (1 per 5 feet)
3. POSITIONING: Where they should be placed IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Detailing the Setup**

I'm now fully immersed in the technical specifications for this patio security screen installation. I've broken down the patio into its key openings and worked out the placement for the vertical mullions to achieve that even 5-foot spacing. I'm focusing on the number and positioning of these mullions. I am calculating that two internal mullions are needed for the wider opening, and one for the narrower one, giving a total of three new mullions in the whole project.




[Part 2]
**Presenting Final Result**

I've carefully compared the image with the user's initial specifications, confirming that all aspects of the instructions have been followed meticulously. The security mesh and mullions are in place with accurate dimensions and positioning. This satisfies all criteria.
