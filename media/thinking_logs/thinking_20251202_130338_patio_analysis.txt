Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Constructing Security Plans**

I'm currently focused on the practical aspects of this security upgrade. I've determined how to add a heavy-duty security screen enclosure to the patio, complete with vertical supports at regular intervals. I'm prioritizing accuracy in the structural design and dimensions. Based on the 15-foot opening, I've calculated the optimal number and placement of mullions to provide robust support. I'm keeping the original architecture of the space, ensuring my updates blend seamlessly with the existing structure.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Complete Alignment**

I'm checking that the generated image satisfies all requirements. The black security screen and mesh are correctly implemented, matching the details. Structural mullions are in place as requested. Now, I will confirm the final output's readiness.
