Step: windows

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Developing Security Measures**

I am currently working on implementing security screens onto the initial house image. My focus is on realistically integrating these screens into the scene. I am identifying all windows and carefully applying the black mesh, making sure it allows some visibility inside. Thin black frames are being added for a complete look. The crucial step now is to accurately model the effects of sunlight and shadows on the mesh, ensuring a believable and textured appearance.




[Part 2]
**Examining the Details**

I'm now carefully checking the generated output against the initial specifications. All elements, from the window mesh to the lighting, are being scrutinized for accuracy and consistency with the provided details. I am now preparing to share this result.
