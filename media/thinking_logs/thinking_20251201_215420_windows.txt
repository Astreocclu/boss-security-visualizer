Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Focusing on Security**

I'm now integrating heavy-duty security screens onto the windows.  The goal is realistic integration with the existing architecture. I'm prioritizing the visual impact of the semi-transparent black mesh, ensuring it darkens the interior view. Lighting and shadows are key, so I'm paying close attention to how sunlight interacts with the metallic weave. I'm making certain the new elements feel flush-mounted.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating Implementation**

I'm checking the output against the original user request. The detailed instructions regarding the security screens seem to be incorporated, particularly the materials and mounting specifics. I am now focused on verifying that all the requested modifications are integrated seamlessly into the scene.
