Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Designing Security Screens**

I am now focusing on the patio area. I've pinpointed the open and covered sections and am proceeding to add black security screens across the entire span. The current plan involves rendering the screen as a robust, semi-transparent black mesh, with visible black aluminum vertical mullions spaced every five feet for support. I will make sure everything appears natural under the existing lighting conditions.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating Implementation Fidelity**

I've carefully assessed the output against the original user prompt. Every element specified, including the specific details of the security screen's installation, spacing, and visibility of mullions, were checked for adherence to the instructions. The result aligns perfectly with the initial request, so the progress is excellent.
