Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Analyzing Security Upgrades**

I'm currently focused on the patio openings, specifically integrating those heavy-duty security screens. My primary concern is the realistic interplay of light and shadow on the mesh texture and newly added mullions. The plan is to ensure those new frames sit flush.  Everything else remains unchanged.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Fidelity**

I'm currently reviewing the output against the provided specifications. I've confirmed that the critical elements, such as the patio enclosures and the specified mullion spacing, are present. I'm focusing on ensuring these elements precisely match the user's explicit instructions. My goal is to determine if all requirements have been correctly incorporated.
