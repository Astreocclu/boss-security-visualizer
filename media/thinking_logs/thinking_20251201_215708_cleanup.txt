[Part 1]
**Removing Yard Clutter**

I'm focusing on the backyard. I've removed all temporary items: furniture, grill, and clutter like hoses and tools. I'm now eliminating the person and birdhouses. The house and trees remain unchanged. Next, I'll work on the sky and lighting to convey a bright, clean look.




[Part 2]
**Validating Request Compliance**

I'm checking that the removal of furniture and the individual was successfully executed. The permanent patio and garden structures remain intact, and the sky alteration seems appropriate. This seems to align with the initial prompt's requirements.
