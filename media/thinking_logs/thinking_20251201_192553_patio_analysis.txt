Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, note:
1. OPENING ANALYSIS: Estimate the width of each patio opening in feet
2. MULLION CALCULATION: How many mullions would be needed (1 per 5 feet)
3. POSITIONING: Where they should be placed IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Implementing Security Measures**

I am estimating the openings and calculating the needed mullions. The upper balcony is approximately 20 feet, requiring four mullions, while the lower patio, at 18 feet, needs three. Currently, I am focused on precise placement of these elements, and I'll proceed to add the security screens, ensuring they look realistic with appropriate lighting and shadows. I am committed to keeping the rest of the scene untouched.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating Implementation**

I'm checking the output against the instructions. The model nailed all the details, especially the placement of the security screens. Every requested element is present and correct based on the prompt's specifications. Now I will present this exact result.
