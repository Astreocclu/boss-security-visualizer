Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Envisioning the Security Screens**

I'm now focusing on the practical aspects of the enclosure. The plan is clear: black security screens, strategically placed and realistically integrated with shadows. I'm visualizing the mesh's transparency, allowing for natural light and shadows. I'm ensuring the mullions will be visible.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Compliance**

I'm checking that the generated image strictly adheres to the prompt's details. The focus is on the correct implementation of the security screen, mesh, and vertical mullions, as well as the accurate lighting. The original elements remain as specified. Based on these considerations, I'll proceed accordingly.
