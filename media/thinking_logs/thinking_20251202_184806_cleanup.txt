--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Defining the Scope**

I'm currently focused on defining the project's scope. My goal is to remove specified elements: furniture, construction materials, debris, and clouds. I'm prioritizing the preservation of the house, patio, pillars, coping, and bush. I've initiated this work on the image, by identifying target elements for removal and defining clear preservation goals.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Scene Fidelity**

I'm now in the process of evaluating the output against the original user input. I've confirmed that the scene is precisely as requested. The model has adhered to every detail, ensuring all permanent fixtures are present and correctly rendered. The current conditions are ideal, with the weather matching the user's explicit instructions.
