Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Focusing on Security**

I'm now implementing the security screens across all windows in the image. I am currently working on rendering a realistic woven mesh texture to ensure the screens look durable and semi-transparent. I'm taking care to generate flush-mounted frames for a clean, integrated appearance. Next, I'll concentrate on the lighting and shadows to ensure the screens look as if they have been installed in the current environment. I'm ensuring the rest of the scene remains as-is.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Compliance**

I'm verifying that the image adheres to the user's detailed request. The model performed the requested modifications, incorporating heavy-duty black security screens with a semi-transparent mesh and flush mounting. Photorealistic lighting has also been rendered. My check is that the image fulfills all requirements. I am satisfied with the result.
