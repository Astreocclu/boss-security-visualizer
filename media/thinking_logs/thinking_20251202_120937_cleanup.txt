[Part 1]
**Refining Backyard Scene**

I'm focusing on the image's core elements: the house, pool, spa, patio, and landscaping. My priority is to clear away all temporary clutter like furniture and construction debris. I plan to clean and enhance the pool and patio surfaces to show clear water and polished stone. Finally, I'll shift the weather to a sunny day, optimizing the lighting to highlight the materials and plants.




[Part 2]
**Checking Instructions Adherence**

I've carefully compared the image with the user's initial specifications, confirming that all requested modifications have been implemented flawlessly. The image now accurately reflects a clean backyard with clear pool water and sunny weather, aligning perfectly with the user's detailed requirements.
