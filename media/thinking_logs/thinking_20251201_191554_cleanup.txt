[Part 1]
**Cleaning & Weather Shift**

I'm currently focused on the scene cleanup, targeting the removal of all transient items. My process then shifts toward weather transformation, striving for that clear, sunny sky. The objective is to apply bright sunlight, resulting in sharper shadows and vibrant reflections, keeping the architectural elements untouched.




[Part 2]
**Validating Image Accuracy**

I'm checking the image against the instructions, focusing on the removal of temporary furniture and sky adjustments. The permanent structure is correctly preserved. I'll make sure it aligns precisely with the given specifications before proceeding.
