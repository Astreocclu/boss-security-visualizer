[Part 1]
**Isolate & Refine Scene**

I'm focused on isolating the core architectural elements. Steps are being taken to clear the scene of any extraneous items. I'm prioritizing a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The goal is a scene with pure lines and a clear, sunny atmosphere. The next task is to enhance the lighting to produce strong shadows.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Alignment**

I'm currently focused on the alignment between the user's request and the image results. My assessment hinges on how well the model has implemented the instructions, specifically related to object removal and scene modification. The current evaluation confirms all required elements are present in the final result.
