Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Developing Modifications**

I'm working on replacing the patio enclosure's standard screens with heavy-duty black security mesh. I'm adding aluminum mullions every 5 feet for structural support. The goal is to create a realistic rendering of the new mesh, which will cast more textured shadows. The existing structure will stay the same.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I'm checking this current image against the user's initial specifications, focusing on crucial details. I've noted the heavy-duty mesh implementation and the precise inclusion of the aluminum mullions as requested in the prompt. My current focus is to ensure the image accurately reflects all the user's parameters.
