[Part 1]
**Constructing Security Screens**

I'm currently working on adding photorealistic security screens to the existing house image. I've pinpointed all the window locations and am proceeding to integrate the heavy-duty mesh. The goal is a semi-transparent effect, maintaining the view but with a visible mesh texture. I am focusing now on the flush mounting of the screens, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with the original black frames and realistic lighting and shadows.

**Analyzing User Requests**

I'm currently focused on evaluating the user's input and comparing it to the generated output. The task involves ensuring the output accurately reflects the specifics of the user's detailed request. I've noted that the response needs to be an exact match to the provided prompt.
