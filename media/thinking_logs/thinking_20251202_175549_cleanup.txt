Step: cleanup

Make the weather conditions ideal and sunny with clear blue sky.
Keep all permanent structures exactly as they are.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Defining the Scope**

I'm currently focused on defining the project's scope. My initial thoughts are centered on cleaning up an original image and then completely changing the weather. My first step is to methodically identify and isolate all the temporary elements within the image. This involves pinpointing all the objects and materials that will need to be removed to present a final, idealized image.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Fidelity**

I'm now carefully checking the output against the original user input. I'm confirming that all specified modifications were done according to the instructions provided. The goal is to ensure complete alignment between the user's request and the final deliverable.
