--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Simplifying the Scene**

I'm focusing on the house and pool as the core elements, removing all non-permanent items. The goal is a clean, minimalist backyard. I'm actively working on transitioning from the overcast sky to a bright, sunny day, aiming for a dramatic lighting shift. Currently, I'm concentrating on producing sunlight effects and crisp shadows.




[Part 2]
**Checking For Compliance**

I've confirmed the model successfully removed the temporary items and furniture as requested, and it has modified the sky as instructed, preserving permanent structures. I am satisfied with the result and believe it matches all of the user's criteria.
