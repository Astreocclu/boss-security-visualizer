--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Revising the Scene**

I'm now focusing on removing the identified clutter: the umbrella, chairs, hoses, and side table. After the removal, I'll work on making the sky bright and blue, and the lighting warm and sunny, with distinct shadows. The pool water will be made crystal clear as I refine the scene.




[Part 2]
**Approving the Output**

I'm verifying that the image matches the initial user request. All modifications were completed as instructed, including removing objects and adjusting the weather. The structural integrity of the house remains, and it meets all criteria of the prompt. I'm satisfied that this is an appropriate output.
