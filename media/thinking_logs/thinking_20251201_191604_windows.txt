Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Visualizing Security Enhancements**

I'm now focusing on the visual aspects of installing the security screens. I've pinpointed the windows and am working to render the mesh with semi-transparency. My current aim is to create flush mounting frames and incorporate realistic sunlight and shadow effects to make the scene appear natural. The goal is to make the windows appear as though they are not only secure, but also perfectly integrated into the house's exterior.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Accuracy Now**

I'm now cross-referencing the generated outcome against the initial instructions to determine alignment. The focus is on a close comparison to ensure comprehensive execution of all the specific details within the request, and to confirm all the requested elements are present.
