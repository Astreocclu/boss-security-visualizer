Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Determining Patio Modifications**

I'm currently focused on the patio and how to approach adding the security screens. I've broken down the steps, starting with analyzing the porch layout, and I've planned to then integrate the screen installation. Details like the mullion spacing and the importance of preserving the current elements are now solidified in my plan. I'm working to make sure the lighting and shadows appear right, so that the modifications look realistic.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Image Fidelity**

I'm currently verifying the output against the original user prompt. My focus is on ensuring all specifications, especially the security screen and mullion placement, are present and accurate. Material properties and lighting are also under scrutiny. The process is nearing completion.
