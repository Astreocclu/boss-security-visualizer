Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Developing the Window Screens**

I'm currently working on the detailed placement and appearance of the security screens. My focus is on achieving a heavy-duty, semi-transparent look. I'm experimenting with different levels of transparency and shadow effects to make them appear realistic and flush with the window frames. The goal is to create a sense of texture and depth. I am trying to make the light play across the mesh.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Specifications**

I'm checking the output against the user's detailed specifications. The generated model appears to have addressed all stated requirements, but I'm still in the review process and haven't fully confirmed this. I'm focusing on the specifics of the installation and how it aligns with the user's intent. The current assessment is positive but more validation is needed before a final determination.
