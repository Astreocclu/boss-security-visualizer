--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Removing & Enhancing Details**

My focus is on cleaning up the existing scene. I'm removing all patio furniture, the plant, and the flag. I'll clear debris from the patio and lawn. Next I'll switch the sky to clear blue and brighten the sunlight. I'll add clean shadows from the porch, and maintain the house's original structure.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I have carefully assessed the generated image. It aligns precisely with the user's instructions regarding object removal and weather alteration. Permanent features are intact. The outcome now awaits further review.
