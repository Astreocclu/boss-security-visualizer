Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, note:
1. OPENING ANALYSIS: Estimate the width of each patio opening in feet
2. MULLION CALCULATION: How many mullions would be needed (1 per 5 feet)
3. POSITIONING: Where they should be placed IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Assessing Patio Security**

I've determined that the patio is approximately 25 feet wide. I've calculated that four internal mullions will be needed to be spaced out 5 feet apart across the span. Next, I plan to add the mullions and fill the open areas of the patio with security mesh, and integrate shadows.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Precise Details**

I've just finished a careful review of the security screen details. I checked that the mullions are correctly spaced for the 25-foot opening. The installation seems consistent with the provided specifications, including the realistic mesh and natural lighting. I'm focusing on ensuring it precisely adheres to every criterion in the prompt.
