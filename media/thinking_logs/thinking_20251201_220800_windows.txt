Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Refining Security Screen Integration**

I'm now focusing on seamlessly incorporating the security screens. Specifically, I'm working on how the mesh interacts with light and shadow for realism. The goal is a flush fit within the window frames, maintaining transparency while adding a subtle texture. I'm ensuring no changes to the rest of the scene.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Compliance**

I'm checking that the created image fully meets the user's detailed instructions, especially concerning the security screens. The requested black, heavy-duty screens are correctly applied to every window, displaying the requested semi-transparent mesh appearance and natural lighting effects, with a flush-mounted design. This version should satisfy all of the user's criteria.
