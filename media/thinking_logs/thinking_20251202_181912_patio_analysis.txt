Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Defining Enclosure Dimensions**

I'm now zeroing in on the precise dimensions of the patio opening. The goal is to accurately calculate the screen width, leading to the necessary number of mullions given the 5-foot spacing. I'm focusing on ensuring the new screen seamlessly integrates into the scene.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Image Accuracy**

I'm currently verifying the image against the user's requirements. The patio enclosure seems accurate, with the specified mesh and mullion spacing implemented. Lighting seems realistic, and the rest of the house remains unchanged. I plan to send the image and associated text soon.
