Step: windows

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Focusing on Implementation**

I'm now zeroing in on integrating the security screens. My plan is to make them look like heavy-duty mesh. The goal is a realistic interplay of light and shadow, with the windows themselves still partially visible behind the mesh. I'm focusing on ensuring the frames are flush with the existing windows.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Image Adherence**

I'm now closely examining the image to ensure complete alignment with the user's detailed specifications. The visual elements, like the heavy-duty security screens on the windows, seem to accurately reflect the prompt's instructions. I'm focusing on the textures, the mounting details, and how the light and shadows are presented to determine compliance.
