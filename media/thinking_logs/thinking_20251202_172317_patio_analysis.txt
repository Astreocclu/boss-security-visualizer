Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Implementing Patio Security**

I am now focusing on implementing the security screens on the patio. I have identified the open patio space and am working to calculate the dimensions to precisely position the black, semi-transparent mesh screens and vertical mullions. The plan is to have mullions every 5 feet across the 30-foot span, carefully considering how the sunlight interacts with the new elements. The goal is to integrate these elements without altering the rest of the scene.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I'm currently focused on verifying this image's adherence to the provided instructions. I am ensuring that the model has correctly implemented the specified details. I need to make certain that the features align with the original design requirements. It is a critical check to ensure the model produces results within specification.
