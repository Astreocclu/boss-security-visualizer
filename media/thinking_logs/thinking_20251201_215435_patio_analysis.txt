Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, note:
1. OPENING ANALYSIS: Estimate the width of each patio opening in feet
2. MULLION CALCULATION: How many mullions would be needed (1 per 5 feet)
3. POSITIONING: Where they should be placed IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Constructing Security Enclosure**

I'm now focused on the specifics of the security screen enclosure. The mesh and mullion count are determined. I plan to insert the black security mesh into the patio and balcony openings. The mesh's semi-transparent nature is important, so I'm considering how to simulate the interaction of light and shadow, and the mesh texture. I need to make sure the original scene is not modified. I'm taking special care with how the mesh will interact with the solid mullions.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing the Request**

I'm now cross-referencing the initial detailed requests with the generated content. I've confirmed that the critical requirements regarding the installation of black security screens with specified mullions and structural support spacing are accurately reflected. All aspects of the instructions have been validated, particularly the spatial elements, ensuring it aligns with the original specifications.
