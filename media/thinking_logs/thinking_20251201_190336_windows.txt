Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Installing Security Screens**

I am currently working on the security screens for the windows. I've begun with identifying all window areas on the brick house and dormer. Next, I'll be defining the mesh material properties. The placement and framing will follow, incorporating realistic lighting effects and making sure to avoid any alteration to other scene elements.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Prompt Alignment**

I'm currently reviewing the output against the provided instructions. So far, the implementation of details like the mesh and mounting appear as requested. I'm focusing on ensuring accurate adherence to the user's initial prompt and specifications.
