--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Adjusting the Scene**

I'm focusing on the house and pool from the starting image. My immediate task is clearing the area.  I'm eliminating all furniture and construction debris. Next, the focus shifts to creating a sunny atmosphere: replacing the overcast sky with clear blue and adding bright sunlight to create more shadows and illumination on the scene. I am preserving the permanent structures.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Complete Compliance**

I'm checking that the generated image fully corresponds to the user's detailed request. The model seems to have meticulously addressed every aspect of the prompt.  All undesired elements appear to have been removed, and the desired modifications, such as the weather, were applied.  I'm now assessing the final output.
