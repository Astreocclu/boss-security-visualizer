[Part 1]
**Constructing Security Additions**

I'm now in the process of adding security screens to the existing house image. I've identified the windows and sliding door that will need screening, focusing on integrating the screens realistically. The plan is to create a semi-transparent black mesh, flush within the frames, with appropriate lighting effects for depth.

**Verifying Prompt Accuracy**

I'm currently reviewing the final generation in detail, cross-referencing it with the original, specific instructions. I've noted the addition of the black security screens to windows and doors. The focus is on ensuring all aspects of the user's request are incorporated, with careful attention to material details. I am proceeding to the next step.
