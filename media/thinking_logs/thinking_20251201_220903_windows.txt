Step: windows

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Visualizing Security Enhancements**

I'm now focusing on the practical application. First, I pinpointed the three sets of windows needing these screens. The emphasis is now on integrating the heavy-duty mesh flawlessly with each window frame, and then I'll use realistic lighting to create depth and shadows on the black mesh. The brick and other elements are unchanged.




[Part 2]
**Validating the details**

I've carefully examined the generated image against the user's explicit instructions. The critical aspects, like the installation of the security screens, the material's properties, and the mounting method, are all consistent with the prompt. The lighting and shadows are particularly relevant, aligning precisely with the described specifications. I've concluded that the output addresses all the user's stated requirements.
