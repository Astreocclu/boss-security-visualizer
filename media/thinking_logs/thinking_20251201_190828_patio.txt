Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Framing the Patio**

I'm focusing now on the structural aspects of the security screen. I'm carefully determining the placement of the vertical aluminum mullions, spacing them consistently every five feet. It's crucial they provide adequate support without obstructing the view. The goal is to integrate the mesh seamlessly, ensuring the flush frames blend with the existing architecture.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Exact Match**

I'm checking that the generated image perfectly adheres to all design requirements. This includes the specified black security screen enclosure, flush frames, and specific details like the heavy-duty mesh texture and the exact placement of vertical mullions. The image also captures realistic lighting. All the criteria are fully met, so I've approved it.
