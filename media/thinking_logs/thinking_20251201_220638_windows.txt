Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Developing Security Enhancements**

I'm currently working on enhancing the image of the house. My latest plan involves integrating photorealistic security screens. I've pinpointed the windows that need this addition and the plan is for black, semi-transparent mesh that appears to be part of the existing frames. I'm focusing now on adding realistic lighting and shadows to the screens to make them appear integrated into the image.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Completion**

I'm verifying the image's accuracy against the user's initial specifications. I've confirmed the implementation of the specified security screens and their integration with the scene's lighting. The focus now is ensuring the final image aligns perfectly with the user's intent, and the level of realism is what the user is expecting.
