# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for historical reference.

## Contents

- `logs/` - Debug session logs, chat exports
- `investigations/` - Completed bug investigations and analyses

## Why Archived?

These files were archived during the December 2025 documentation reorganization because:
1. They reference outdated file structures (homescreen_project → visualizer_project)
2. Issues they investigate have been resolved
3. They've been superseded by newer documentation

## Still Need Something?

Check the active docs in the parent `docs/` directory or `docs/README.md` for the current documentation index.
